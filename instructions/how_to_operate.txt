First: 
	Turn on raspberry pi and wait for it to connect to your mobile's hotspot. When it connects to the hotspot log into your raspberry pi via ssh. Open a terminal in your laptop and type in:
	$ ssh rpi@192.168.43.108 
	
If done correctly it will ask for your raspberry pi password. 

If it shows something like a warning message, just ignore it and type 'yes'.

If nothing happens after pressing enter, then it's possible that the ip address has changed. The last parts [108] can sometimes change, I gave here the last IP addres I while meeting you. Try changing the last 3 digits of the IP address to 101,102,103 etc...Soon you will find the correct one and it will ask for the password. Note down the ocrrect IP address. IP addreses usually remain same in 24 hours. If you can't figure it out, contact me.

Second:
	If you successfully logged into your raspberry pi then open a terminal type in: 
		$ roscore
	This will start you ros operation core.
Then:

	Keep the roscore terminal, don't close it. minimize it if necessary. Open another terminal (ctrl + alt + t) and type the following commands as per your need.

	Start Cemera but don't detect object: $ rosrun weed_detection image_publish.py
	Start Camera and detect objects: $ rosrun weed_detection image_process_publish.py

	Read from camera but don't detect object: $ rosrun weed_detection image_subscribe.py
	Read from camera and detect object: $ rosrun weed_detection image_process_subscribe.py

	Start gps: $ rosrun weed_detection gps.py
